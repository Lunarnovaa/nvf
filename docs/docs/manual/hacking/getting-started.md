# Getting Started {#sec-contrib-getting-started}

You, naturally, would like to start by forking the repository to get started. If
you are new to Git and GitHub, do have a look at GitHub's
[Fork a repo guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for
instructions on how you can do this. Once you have a fork of **nvf**, you should
create a separate branch based on the most recent `main` branch. Give your
branch a reasonably descriptive name (e.g. `feature/debugger` or
`fix/pesky-bug`) and you are ready to work on your changes

Implement your changes and commit them to the newly created branch and when you
are happy with the result, and positive that it fulfills our
[Contributing Guidelines](#sec-guidelines), push the branch to GitHub and
[create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
The default pull request template available on the **nvf** repository will guide
you through the rest of the process, and we'll gently nudge you in the correct
direction if there are any mistakes.
