# Known Issues and Quirks {#ch-known-issues-quirks}

At times, certain plugins and modules may refuse to play nicely with your setup,
be it a result of generating Lua from Nix, or the state of packaging. This page,
in turn, will list any known modules or plugins that are known to misbehave, and
possible workarounds that you may apply.

<!-- If adding a new known quirk, please create a new page in quirks/ and include
the name of the file here.-->
